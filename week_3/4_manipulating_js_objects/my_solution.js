// This challenge wasn't too bad. The test helped a ton to figure out what to do and get things done. 
// Deleting the eyeColor property from terah took some research. Also the syntax for adding the children took some effort. 
// I enjoyed this challenge there were a lot of things to learn and they weren't too repetitive. 
// Nothing was too tedious.
