## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository

<p> git add , git commit -m "message", git push
</p>	
- Fetch changes
<p> git fetch upstream, git merge upstream/master
	</p>
- Commit locally
<p> git add, git commit -m "message"
## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)

## Release 6: Reflection
<p> Using the terminal is relatively easy I had no real problems using the terminal. The hard part is just memorizing the commands so they are readily available and also to know what they do.
I just ran into a problem where it can not commit or add files into the staging area. I was going to try to resave and then try again.
