I learned a lot about design and user experience from the reading and applying that knowledge to the visual experience of websites. Wireframing and stylesheets using css is very important and it takes some work to get it done. Design thinking is an very interesting area of expertise and can be essential for products and experiences. I think a good way to look at design is that it focuse on the future rather than the past or present or not focusing on time at all. It is a different way of looking at things. Another way of thinking about design is that it combines empathy, creativity, and rationality to solve problems and actually design things. The user experience is designed using these problems.

I like design and user experience. I think the perfect analogy is that it is not enough to conquer but it is necessary to seduce. It was fun to work on my website, but i only lament that much more needs to be done. Planning the wireframe of the website was okay it is just there is so much that is possible. which wireframe should i use?

The questions i asked during this challenge was how to do things and what tools should i use. I answered those questions by using google, wikipedia, google +. I think the concept that i am having trouble with is really visualizing the empathy factor in wireframing and design. I tend to just put things in three boxes: really awesome beautiful, okay and practical, and bad. I learned a lot about how websites are designed especially a lot about wireframing and the tools that are used. The subject of design thinking seems really difficult. I feel like I am not that creative and that it is a skill that is in your genes and can not be developed. I need to try to do a lot more wireframing to get better at it.

I enjoyed the final product of the challenge when everything was done. I liked debugging the website and making sure everything worked. There is something about a finished product there's this satisfaction of when the job is done. It is the act of creating and producing that brings joy. I found using the wireframing tool a little tedious; i used balsamiq mockups for wireframing. Wireframing the websites took some time and was a little tedious.
