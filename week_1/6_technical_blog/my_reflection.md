Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

THis was pretty simple, but the only problem I had was updating the index with the link to the blog. I think the problem may be that it takes time for the server to update the link. I did enjoy doing a blog it adds some creativity. the blog itself and organizing the style sheets is cumbersome but i worked through it. I felt best about the content and less certain about the styling.
