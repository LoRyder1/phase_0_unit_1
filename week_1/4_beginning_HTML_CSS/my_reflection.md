It makes sense that everything needs to be defined on how you want things on the webpage. Everything seems harder than it should be. It seems like everything could be easier and more intuitive. 
I guess html is good because every browser supports it. Also it is easy and simple to learn. It is also free. 
I did have aha moments like understanding that html is a language that needs to be learned and there is a lot of vocab to know. the purpose of a web browser is to read html that is somtheing new. 
I think the best resource that i found is wikipedia.
