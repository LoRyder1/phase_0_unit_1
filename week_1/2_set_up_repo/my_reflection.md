## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

  Creating a repository involves first logging onto GitHub and then clicking on repositories and then click on create new. Filling out the new repository form is next. After that is done and you have clicked on the create button open up the GIt app and find your new repository in the remote repository section and on the side toolbar click on the clone button. 
  Open source essentially means sharing how a computer program was made and letting anyone make changes as they see fit. 
  I think Open Source is great. It allows for personalization and customization of software and it is also free. Open source does make you protective of your property and work so there is little to no credit for the work you have done. Open source does feel like utopia but there are things wrong with that. 
  Using licenses is important because it is the license that allows you the software to be used, modified, and shared. Licenses allow others to help you because copyright is automatic. 
  This challenge was relatively simple and it did teach you about cloning a repository in the remote location to the local location. I didn't really struggle with this one. 
  I didn't really look for resources to help with this topic besides looking up open source and licenses.
