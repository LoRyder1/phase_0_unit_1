## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

  My struggles setting up git were just making sure I used a consistent username, computer name, folder name, and github username which is usually not your given name but like your nickname. Consolidating usernames and passwords is pretty important. Also when installing git i forgot to add a desktop icon so I didn't know where it was for a while. I was initially confused on the difference between git and GitHub and tried to access one with the other, but then i began to read the unit reading which helped a lot. Setting up the ssh with github was interesting and just needed to be done carefully. I learned that it is important to read everything and code carefully and write down things that i might need later. 
  Understanding Git before GitHub is important. Git is the name of a software program that is used for software developers. Git is used because of its capacity for collaboration and its ability to track and revert changes. A good metaphor for git is that it can be thought of as a tree with many branches. Each branch can be a different version of your software that you can merge or cutoff from the trunk; the choice is yours. You can also think of it Git allowing you the ability to create parallel universes and making a choice of what universe you want live in. 
  Meanwhile GitHub is more of a online hub of repositories of different versions of the project you are working on. While git is local GitHub is on a server and remote where you can compare and collaborate on your project. You have to push and pull versions from GitHub to add and get versions of the project you are working on to your local Git. GitHub is open, fast, easy, and social.
  Version control is having the ability to control which branch or which universe you want to go along with in Git with GitHub. GitHub is really good at organizing and filing different versions especially when the user commits different versions periodically to save his/her work. 
  I think developers use version control (git) so they can make the project more open and collaborative; ideas on how to improve code can come from anywhere and anyone so it is always a good idea to make the project open so collaborators with different experiences and knowledge can help and contribute. 
  It makes sense how using this software and hub makes sharing a lot more practical and version control also makes sense for all the debugging of software that may be needed. WHat doesn't make sense is why git could not be even more user friendly. THere are still some situations where it can be easier and is unnecessarily complex.
