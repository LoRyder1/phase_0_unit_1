	The 2 new things I learned about the web was that first the web is not the same as the internet and second that the web is one of many things built on top of the internet. 
	Html is the only thing that you have to have in order to make a website. Html describes what each part of a web page is to your browser. 
	WHen I saw my webpage live i felt like I had just built something which was pretty awesome. 
	I did have some aha moments and I am just amazed that there is really good software to help make this seem relatively easy. 
	I didn't really find or look for resources to help understand the topic.
