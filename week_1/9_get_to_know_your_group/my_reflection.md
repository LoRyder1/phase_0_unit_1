What's up you guys? I wanted to finally introduce myself.

My name is Lovinder Pnag. I grew up in Modesto, CA in the central valley. I went to school in LA and I am in Fremont (Bay Area) currently. My favorite websites are mostly news and sports websites: nytimes.com, wsj.com, si.com, and I also like looking at flipboard sometimes. My Gregoric Thinking style is Concrete Sequential and my learning style is Multimodal.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

After reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC I feel vindicated on the feelings I have been feeling for the last two weeks. There are some fears that seem universal: overwhelmed by the workload, worry over ability, and angst over the futur. I have all those fears as well. I think reading about others fears really made me feel better especially the fact that I wasn't alone. Everyone wants the opposite of loneliness. No one wants to be alone. I don't think there is a word for the opposite of loneliness but if there is that's what I want. The last week has really confirmed my feelings and has really been a motivating factor for me to step up my game.
