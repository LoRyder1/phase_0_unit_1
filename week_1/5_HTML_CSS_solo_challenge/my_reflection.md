I asked a lot of questions for this challenge and google was my best friend. I had to look up what div code in html looks like. I used wikipedia to understand a few things and w3schools helped a lot too. 
I am having trouble with linking the stylesheets to the html doc. It seems confusing. I had to look that part up and i am not sure i can do it again. 
I learned a lot in this challenge like adding the orientation of the pages and how to write that out. 
I am so so on the learning competencies for this challenge. I need to shape up and get better and put some time in. 
I enjoyed the end product that was cool, the coding at times and checking to see if it worked was a little tedious.
