	I learned a lot about design and user experience. A lot of design is about organization and thinking about the future experience of users. Design is about solving a problem and their really is no right answere but some answers are better than others but they can solve different problems. It really depends on who you are targeting with your design; who your expected audience is.

<p> I really like design and usere experience my only problem with it right now is just that it takes a lot of time. There is always something to do or something to improve upon. It is possible to sink a lot of time into it.

	I think the best process is to write everything down and plan everything on paper starting with the wireframe. Starting with the wireframe it is best to have multiple different possibilites and then picking one of them. Next labeling each section of your wirefram with a tag is helpful and a best practice. I think doing everything on the computer all in one go can make things really slow, difficult, and substandard.

	I have a lot to improve on my website. I still haven't been able to box the different sections up. I want to create a navigation link bar at the top with the different units of phase 0. I also may want to change the color schemes as well as having the text wrap around the pictures.

	It is difficult to apply the material I learned but it isn't impossible. I think i found that fact that you can use any font and any color pretty awesome. I think google has some really cool fonts that are really nicely organized.

	Google of course was a pretty awesome resouce. W3C is also another really good resource.
