# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	Web standards are generally a good thing. Having a set of standardized best practices for building web sites and having a philosophy of design is generally helpful for everyong making the websites.

<p>
	THe standard structure does make sense to me. The structure is the best in an imperfect world. Everything needs to be closed, everything has the best name for it. 
</p>
<p>
	I do  like the HTML 5 elements and I believe they generally are helpful. I think the good thing for me is that I didn't have to get used to the previous version of HTML so there really isnt too much adjustment on my part. 
</p>

<p>
	The reason reset is necessary because browsers don't have the same standards so everything has to be reset so it looks the same across different browsers. 

</p>

<p>
	I have used the main big browsers like IE, Firefox, and Chrome. I do remeber using Netscape a long time ago. I have never really noticed that different browsers display sites differently that is essentially a new revelation. I think its generally a bad thing that they do it would be better if everything was standardized.

<p>
	I didn't really look at any unorthodox sources besides google
