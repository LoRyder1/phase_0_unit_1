# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model is a cross platform an language-indepedent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. A good way to look at is that DOM is a collection of different elements in HTML put into a tree format. So you can see more or less of your code by clicking on the tree symbols. I think DOM makes things a lot more organized and easier to access. Also the objects in the DOM tree can be addressed and manipulated using methods on the objects.

	Using Chrome Web tools is pretty awesome and I think using it makes modifying and analysing websites easier. I think using Dev Tools on my own website was interesting; using the network tab was especially informative. Comparing this info to the results on the wordpress.com website really let me know where my website was at.

	I didn't have any "aha" moments. I was a little familiar with file formats and page uploading. I really like the minify option to make the page load faster. I didn't look at any extra resources besides wikipedia.
