	Responsive web design is using a grid system so that you use percentages of the screen of the user to determine the margins, padding, heights, and widths. This is a really good practice because of the new tecnologies and maintaining separate websites for different resolutions which is ridiculously redundant. This new practice makes it so all you need to do is just keep one website that works everywhere.

	Smartphones and tablets have changed web design especially as we are spending a lot more time on those devices instead of on desktops or laptops. So i think web design is geared more towards smartphones and tablets especially nowadays while destop sites are more for utility. I think new technology will make websites a lot more interesting because the speed of load times will be a lot quicker so more and more information can be put on the site without affecting the speed. THe site can therefore be outrageously cool.

	Visually impaired people experience the web completely differently than impaired people. the difference is they can't experience the website at all and if they can they probably only know the text of the website. A lot of the mystique of websites is the visually experience. We experience our environment a lot more visually than we have in the past especially with television, videogames, social media and pictures, and know the internet. I think it should be a goal for every web developer to include the visually impaired in web design - although it may be a lot extra work; providing accessiblity is an important ideal to achieve to make the web as inclusive as possible.

	The ideas and concepts that have resonated with me when learning about the web and design is that using a standard that can work across different platforms is important. Thinking about how design will look on those different platforms should be done before a website is designed. Using percentage of the screen, etc is a lot better than using hard numbers for different screens.
