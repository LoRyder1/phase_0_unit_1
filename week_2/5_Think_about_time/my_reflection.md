# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	My biggest time management challenge during phase 0 was my job. My job was taking in excess of 40 hours per week. That consumed a large portion of my time and it was hard to keep up with DBC. Luckily that time sink has been plugged. I have a lot more time to work now but other demons or problems can sometimes get out of the wordwork.

	I like a lot of the techniques described in the reading. I particularly liked the meditation as well positive behavioral habits. Another important idea to really stick myself to is the growth mindset. I think the make it big by starting small is really useful. The phrase " confidence is just displayed ability" really resonated with me. I think it comes down to just doing the small things well first. The starting point to build confidence is succeeding at the little things and then building up to bigger challenges to keep your interest. A constant tension is required to guard against apathy. I remember the famous basketball coach John Wooden would first have his players put on their long socks slowly and correctly. The socks were important not just to prevent blisters but also the act of putting them on required patience and endurance. Those are some of the key qualities important for many things. It was important to start small and do that right in order to do the big things right.

<p> My overall plan for Phase 0 is to essentially put in as much time as possible. The goal is to do put in a lot of time into extra or bonus resources to become better prepared.
